# Turing Machine Index Suite
## About
The Turing Machine Index Suite is a command-line program written in Python with two operating modes for working with Turing machine indexing.
### Indexer Mode
Indexer mode accepts user-input instructions for a Turing machine as numbers separated by spaces, and calculates the index number for that machine according to the Prime Power Method.
### Decoder Mode
Decoder mode accepts a user-input index number and generates the instructions for its Turing machine according to the Prime Power Method, in a nicely-formatted chart.
